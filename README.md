# neural-networks-from-scratch
Practice implementations and notes following Andrej Karpathyâ€™s "Neural Networks: Zero to Hero" series. This repo contains notebooks where I build neural networks from scratch to better understand the concepts and mechanics behind them. Though this is just the practicing but it was really interesting to build the neural networks from scratch.
